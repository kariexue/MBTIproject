MBTI vs Spotify playlists

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
source("plots.R")
```

The first plot shows a boxplot for the distribution of minor chords proportions for each MBTI personality type. 
```{r}
readRDS("figure_rds/plot1.rds")
```

We can see that the left two columns seem to have a lower average percent than the right two columns, which corresponds to the T/F distinction. We would like to delve deeper by making a second plot comparing the histograms of the minor chord proportion distribution for T(hinking) vs F(eeling) personality types.
```{r}
readRDS("figure_rds/plot2.rds")
```
