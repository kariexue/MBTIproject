MBTI and Spotify project:

The aim of this project is to investigate associations between Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) types and music taste according to personalized spotify playlists. We are interested to see if a particular MBTI or any of the four personality categories are more likely to appreciate a specific music attribute, such as acousticness, speechiness, and danceability. We will generate various tables and figures to aid our investigations.
